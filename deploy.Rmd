## Instructions

'Knit' this file to reload the data from Corona Data Scraper and deploy the app.  Alternatively, one can run all chunks.

### Step 1: Re-download county level data file

```{r}
# Re-download the file from Corona Data Scraper to prevent download on each Shiny session (time consuming)
download.file("https://coronadatascraper.com/timeseries-tidy.csv",
              destfile = "data/timeseries-tidy.csv")

```

### Step 2: Deploy the app

```{r}
library(rsconnect)

# TODO: need to set this up manually.  Look under Tokens from the Profile section
rsconnect::setAccountInfo(
  name="<ACCOUNT>",
  token="<TOKEN>",
  secret="<SECRET>"
)

deployApp()
```
