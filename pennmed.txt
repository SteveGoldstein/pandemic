The model consists of individuals who are either Susceptible (S), Infected (I),
or Recovered (R).
The epidemic proceeds via a growth and decline process.
This is the core model of infectious disease spread
and has been in use in epidemiology for many years.
The dynamics are given by the following 3 equations.

S[t+1] <- S[t] * (1 - beta * I[t])
I[t+1] <- I[t] * (1 - gamma + beta * S[t])
R[t+1] <- R[t] + gamma * I[t]

To project the expected impact to Penn Medicine, we estimate the terms of the model.
To do this, we use a combination of estimates from other locations,
informed estimates based on logical reasoning,
and best guesses from the American Hospital Association.

beta = tau * c = effective contact rate
tau = transmissibility = virulence of pathogen
c = average number of people exposed, which can be changed by social distancing
gamma = inverse of mean recovery time in days = 1/14
R0 = basic reproduction number = average number of people infected by an infected person
R0 = beta / gamma
g = beta * S - gamma = early phase growth
S0 = initial population size
R0 = 0 = initial recovered
I0 = 1 = initial infected


gamma <- 1 / 14
double <- 8.5 # time to doubling
growth = 2 ^ (1 / double) - 1
S0 <- 1000000
beta <- (growth + gamma) / S0
